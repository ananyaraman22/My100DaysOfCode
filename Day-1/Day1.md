# Day -1 

Currently I'm learning javascript. 
This is a To- do list, by using it you can easily list up all the tasks that you need to do and keep a track of your day to day tasks. 
You can simply enter the task then it will be shown in the task list on the left side. Also you can rename the task, and click the checkbox once the task gets completed and also you can simply delete the task by clicking on the cross on the front of that task.
